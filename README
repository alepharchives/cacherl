Cacherl is an Erlang port of famous Memcached trying to take advantage of
both Erlang and Memcached. It follows the simple interface of memcached
with additional data persistence. All memcached clients (C/PHP/Perl/...)
can access Cacherl without any code modification. Moreover, the distributing
of cached data is ensured by Erlang instead of memcached client hashing,
so we don't need to worry about data invalidation when adding more servers.
